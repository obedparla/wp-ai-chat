## 2026-02-09: Provider REST endpoint (PRD item 3)

Implemented WPAIP_API class with POST /wpaip/v1/chat endpoint.

What was done:
- Created includes/class-wpaip-api.php with REST route registration
- Auth via X-WPAIP-Site-Key header (hash_equals against stored site_key)
- Request validation: messages array required, each msg needs role+content (with exceptions for tool/assistant+tool_calls messages), tools must be array, model must be string
- Added site_key to default settings on activation (auto-generated UUID)
- Wired WPAIP_API into WPAIP_Loader
- Added WP stubs (WP_REST_Request, WP_REST_Response, WP_Error, register_rest_route, wp_generate_uuid4)
- 16 new tests (23 total), all passing
- handle_chat returns placeholder response — next feature will add OpenAI forwarding

## 2026-02-09: OpenAI proxy streaming (PRD item 4)

Replaced placeholder in handle_chat with actual OpenAI forwarding + SSE streaming.

What was done:
- Created WPAIP_Streamer class: wraps openai-php/client, streams response chunks as SSE `data:` lines
- Streamer emits each chunk via `data: {json}\n\n`, errors as `data: {"error":...}\n\n`, terminates with `data: [DONE]\n\n`
- WPAIP_API::handle_chat now validates → checks API key → sets SSE headers → delegates to streamer → exits
- Extracted validate_chat_request as public method for testability
- Streamer injectable via set_streamer() for testing with mocks
- Updated WPAIP_Loader to require class-wpaip-streamer.php
- 34 tests (11 new), all passing: validation, auth, no-API-key error, param building with/without tools/model, SSE formatting

## 2026-02-09: Chatbot-to-provider conversation loop (PRD item 5)

Chatbot backend routes through provider, handles tool calls locally, loops until final text response.

What was done:
- WPAIC_Chat: added is_provider_mode() — true when provider_url + provider_site_key both set
- Constructor skips OpenAI client init when in provider mode
- send_stream() delegates to send_stream_via_provider() when provider mode active
- send_stream_via_provider() → provider_completion_loop(): recursive loop that sends to provider, parses SSE, detects tool_calls, executes locally, appends results, re-requests
- stream_from_provider(): opens HTTP stream via fopen(), parses SSE lines, extracts raw OpenAI chunks (content deltas, tool_calls), returns collected tool_calls or empty on text-only
- Tool call events (tool_input_start, tool_input_delta, tool_input_available, tool_output_available) emitted to frontend same as direct mode
- send() non-streaming also supports provider via send_via_provider() wrapper
- Admin: added provider_url + provider_site_key fields to API tab with fieldset grouping (Provider Mode vs Direct Mode)
- Sanitization: provider_url via esc_url_raw, provider_site_key via sanitize_text_field, in api tab_fields
- 14 new tests (11 chat + 3 admin): provider mode detection, SSE text parsing, SSE tool call parsing, error handling, connection failure, settings sanitization
- Files changed:
  - includes/class-wpaic-chat.php (provider streaming + loop)
  - includes/class-wpaic-admin.php (provider fields in API tab + sanitization)
  - tests/WPAIC_ChatTest.php (11 new tests)
  - tests/WPAIC_AdminTest.php (3 new tests)
  - prd.json (marked passes: true)
- All checks pass: 162 PHP tests, 147 frontend tests

## 2026-02-09: Provider admin settings page (PRD item — last remaining)

Provider plugin now has a WordPress admin settings page for managing configuration.

What was done:
- Created includes/class-wpaip-admin.php with:
  - add_admin_menu(): registers "AI Provider" top-level menu page
  - register_settings(): registers wpaip_settings with sanitize callback, adds section + 3 fields
  - render_site_key_field(): read-only input with Copy button (clipboard API)
  - render_api_key_field(): password-masked input for OpenAI API key
  - render_model_field(): select dropdown with gpt-4o-mini / gpt-4o / gpt-5
  - sanitize_settings(): trims API key, validates model against allowed list, preserves site_key from DB
  - render_settings_page(): standard WP settings form with capability check
  - get_available_models(): returns model ID => label map
- Wired WPAIP_Admin into WPAIP_Loader (loads only when is_admin())
- Added WP admin stubs: add_menu_page, register_setting, add_settings_section, add_settings_field, sanitize_text_field, esc_attr, esc_html, esc_html__, __, current_user_can, get_admin_page_title, settings_fields, do_settings_sections, submit_button, is_admin
- 15 new tests in WPAIP_AdminTest covering all PRD verification steps
- All 60 provider tests passing
- prd.json: all items now pass — PRD complete
